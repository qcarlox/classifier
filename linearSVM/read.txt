run findBestFrame for feature extraction + cross val
set directories and frame range in findBestFrame
set C range linerSvmCv
results in results.txt
linearSvmCv saves the svm model but it saves the last model created
so it wont save the model with best framesize
run again for best framesize to save the best model

To do testing run linearSvmTesting
It requires a model generated by linear SVM
